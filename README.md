# **SMM635 - Data Visualization (Midterm Project)**

## **Overview**
Since its announcement in 2016, the notion of Brexit has had an impact on numerous industries across Europe. Analysing the financial data of the English, French and German markets between January 2014 and December 2018, the members of group 7 have gained valuable insights about the long-term and short-term impacts of Brexit. These insights are visualised keeping in mind the aim to support the write up for the upcoming article in The Economist.
